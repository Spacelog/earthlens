    <h2>What is Earth Lens?</h2>
    <p>
        For over forty years, astronauts have orbited Earth, looking down
        and admiring their home from space, taking photos along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Earth Lens takes these photos - published by NASA - and curates
        them, letting you easily see the best photos from different missions.
    </p>

    <h2>The team behind Earth Lens</h2>
    <p>
        Earth Lens is an entirely volunteer effort, and was built by a
        core team of four people, with many others helping to rate and
        classify the thousands of photos.

    <h2>Made on an island</h2>
    <p>
        Earth Lens is a <a href="http://www.devfort.com">/dev/fort</a> project,
        meaning that it was created in just one week, in isolation, on the Isle
        of Eigg in Scotland.

        For six days we lived and worked together, cooking for each other,
